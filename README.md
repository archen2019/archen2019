### Hey there!

I'm Andrew Chen, a sophomore at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science. 

Here's a little bit about me: 
- I’m currently working at [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) as a summer intern. 
- I’m currently learning Golang and I'm planning on taking a look into Rust. 
- I'm fascinated by any project that aims to beat humans, whether it be at poker, chess, Starcraft, or something else.
